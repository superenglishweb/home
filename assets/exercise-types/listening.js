            Junko: Hello, Junko Mori speaking. How can I help you? <br>

            Andrea: Hi, Junko, it's Andrea here from Red Band. I'm calling about our latest order. <br>

            Junko: Everything arrived OK, right? We got the delivery confirmation at our end. <br>

            Andrea: Yes, everything's fine with the order. I'm calling about the invoice and the payment terms. I need a favour. <br>

            Junko: A favour? What do you need? <br>

            Andrea: This is a little, er ... difficult, but I need an extension on the payment terms. I know they're usually 30 days, but we're having some cash flow problems. You'd really be helping us out if you could extend it to 60 days. <br>

            Junko: I'm not sure if I can do that, Andrea. We've got regulations at our end, and also have to manage our own cash flow. <br>

            Andrea: I promise this won't become the norm, Junko. Actually, I also want to place another new order. The same size order as last time. It's for an important customer and they pay on delivery. <br>

            Junko: I see. So your cash flow problem will be solved after this new order is delivered. <br>

            Andrea: Exactly. <br>

            Junko: That sounds good. Hold on, Andrea. Let me see what I can do. Yes, I think we can make an exception this time. <br>

            Andrea: That's great, Junko. I appreciate your help. <br>

            Junko: And we appreciate your business, Andrea. It works both ways. <br>

            Andrea: Thanks again, Junko. Can you send me a quick email confirmation of the payment terms extension? <br>

            Junko: Sure, no problem. We're happy to help you. <br>

            Andrea: Great. And I'll email you the new order. <br>

            Junko: Thanks. I'll keep an eye out for it. Talk to you soon. <br>

            Hi, everyone. I know you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing quick. I have some important information about a change in the management team. As you already know, our head of department, James Watson, is leaving his position at the end of this week. His replacement is starting at the end of the next month. In the meantime, we'll continue with our projects as usual. <br>

            I have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time. <br>

            Don't worry, we've found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It's only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I know how much you all love working late! <br>

            The other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can't use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card. The total amount put on your company ID card comes off your salary at the end of each month. <br>

            OK. That's it? Are there any questions? <br>
